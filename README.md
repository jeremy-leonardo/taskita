## About Taskita

Taskita is a project developed for Binus Festival and COMP6100 - Software Engineering.

This is one of the projects we did for the 4th semester.

We developed a bag rental website. The website is also responsive, which supports mobile device screens.

The website used Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery, MySQL for development, and PostgreSQL for the production server. We used conditional statements to check the database (whether it's PostgreSQL or MySQL) and implement different query keyword for both. We use different environments in development and production because of cost-efficiency.

We used Figma to design our website. Our first design looks very bad. But after several sprints, we made several changes to make it look better. We also learned that color is important in design, although we are not an artist, we did our best.
